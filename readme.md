# Laxmi Chit Fund ðŸ¤©

Infrastructure to support the research and experimentation of my undergrad thesis in software engineering, assessing:

> **To what extent are Smallcases Kelly-Optimal, and how can their collective risk adjusted excess return be maximised?**

## Structure

- Backend: FastAPI backend to validate and server market data.

- Cloud Functions: Individual serverless components with single responsibilities for scraping, modelling, etc.

- Frontend: React Native frontend to display information on Smallcases in a more consumable manner.

- Notebooks: Experimentation, initial data collection and validation.

Methods to build and develop locally are mentioned in the individal repositories' readmes.
